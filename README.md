# Tailwind CSS Gradient Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug related to unexpected behavior in Tailwind CSS gradients.  The gradient either doesn't render correctly or doesn't appear at all, despite using seemingly valid Tailwind classes.

## Bug Description
The provided HTML code uses the `bg-gradient-to-r` class along with `from-blue-500` and `to-purple-500` to create a linear gradient.  However, the gradient is not rendered as expected. This bug is likely caused by an issue with the Tailwind CSS configuration or a conflict with other CSS rules.
